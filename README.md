# Weather Map

A React App that allows users to see the forecast for a given day for any US city they input.
These forecasts will be displayed on an interactive map. Cooler forecasts show up with a blue 
marker and warmer ones show up in red.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
